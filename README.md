# Tic Tac Toe
## This project shows a tic tac toe game.

## Description
### Player 1 goes first, click on any square and it will show an "X". Then it is Player 0's turn and any square they click on will show an "O". Continue until one player gets 3 in a row and it will show "Player _ wins!" at the bottom of the screen. The background is an image uploaded from google.

## How to run it.
### You must download the zip file. Then open up a terminal path and open the HTML file. 

## Furture Improvements
### I would like to make the text a little more flashy. I would also like to make the background color of the tiles into images. When the player wins I would like the text to become animated. Finally,  I would add a 'Try Again' button for when you want to restart the game.
