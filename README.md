# Tic Tac Toe
## This project shows a tic tac toe game.

## Description
### Click the box in the upper left hand corner that says "Show bus stops along Central Park West" and the tracker will move to the stops the bus makes. I changed the color of the button and the text contained inside the button. I added a shadow to the box and outlined the text as well. I wanted the colors to match some of those on the map. 

## How to run it.
### You must download the zip file. Then open up a terminal path and open the HTML file. 

## Furture Improvements
### I'd like to make it more specific so users would know the exact location by hovering over the location marker.
